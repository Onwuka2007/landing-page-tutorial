### Snap — Landing Page Tutorial (HTML & CSS)

This repository contains the project files for my YouTube tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themannyverse">youtube.com/themannyverse</a>, where we built a clean, simple landing page for a fictional product called Snap.

## Project Structure:
HTML-CSS Tutorial/

- starter/      (contains the initial HTML, CSS, and assets to begin the tutorial)
- final/        (contains the completed landing page)
- README.md

## Starter Files
starter/
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  └── images/
    └── logo.svg

The starter folder includes a minimal HTML structure with a linked CSS file and a favicon. It also has CSS variables set up for colors, fonts, spacing, and border radius. The HTML contains a basic header, a hero section, and a footer. This is what you use to follow along with the video.

## Final Files
final/
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  └── images/
    └── logo.svg

The final folder contains the fully built Snap landing page with completed styling, responsive layout, and organized code. Use it to compare your work or explore the completed project.
